# practice
An archive of practice problems found on leetcode and my solutions to them.

The idea is to use different programming languages in order for me to gain a better understanding of them. From a purely practical standpoint, using a language such as Python 3 would be better. However, as this is an educational endeavor, efficiency is not my highest priority. 

To anyone watching this repository,
Cheers!
